# Pentomino - A simple Puzzle

How many different solutions does this puzzle have?

This little puzzle resurfaced the other day when we were looking for board games to play. I call it Pentomino and have had it for a very long time. It has always fascinated me because it is so difficult, yet whenever you finally find a solution, it seems to be a new one. Thus the question. 

A long time ago, in 1995, while I worked on my first job, I decided to write a C-program to find the answer, and after cracking my head for quite a while, my pentomino program eventually printed out every possible solution.
This repository has the old source code, which compiles fine on my laptop in the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Back in 1995, the task took my home PC a solid 25min to complete. Today, on my laptop, it needs less than 4s!

So how many different solutions do you think there are?
